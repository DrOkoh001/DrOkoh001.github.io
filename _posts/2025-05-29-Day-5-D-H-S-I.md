### Day 4 of the Project Management Course ###

Today, I made more progress with my Gantt Chart. It looks really good! I am really proud of myself. This is the most organized I've ever been entering a project. I found some time to review citation and data management systems and I think I'm going to combine [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org20%Zotero) with [DevonThink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink20%DevonThink). It will cost a bit of money, so I quickly filled out a short application through our Office of Research Programs to help pay for some of the cost of these tools. I factored in time to learn how to use these systems in my Gantt Chart--my way of holding myself accountable to actually learn how to best use these tools. 

Here is my beautiful Gantt Chart:

Once our course let out for the day, I attended the afternoon conference, which showcased some really interesting digital humanities projects:
> a digital mapping project that enabled a historian--Trey Proctor (Denison University)--to recreate a social network of Africans in Mexico in the 1630s, when Mexico had the second largest enslaved population in the Atlantic world.
> A project facilitating grassroots data activism among lesbian feminists in Latin America (LesboCenso). It was nuanced and complex, bringing together an "intersectional, decolonial, and anti-carceral" framework to support the movement's documentary work.
> John Henry Chukwudi's digital mapping project on postcolonial Lagos, using literature to reconstruct lost cultural heritage in the city.

It is an understatement to say that my brain has reached its limit. However, I am really inspired and energized by all the ways people are using technology to enhance and present their research. It has been a long time since I've had the chance to really soak in new ideas, different research approaches, and to just learn. I'm really enjoying this experience!

A subset of students and I made our way off campus to find this really cute ice cream shop in the middle of a quiet and quaint neighborhood (I am not sure which neighborhood it was). I enjoyed their company, and we enjoyed our treat!
