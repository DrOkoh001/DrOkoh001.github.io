# Welcome to my digital humanities sandbox!

Hello World! I'm Dr. Okoh and I am an Associate Professor of African History at Loyola University Maryland. This is an experimental space as I learn and test out digital humanities skills for both my teaching and scholarship. I'll share thoughts and questions as I learn, and hope to hear from you as I follow this journey. I may need help along the way!
