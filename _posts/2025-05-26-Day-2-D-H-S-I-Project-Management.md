# Day 1: Project Management

Initially, I wasn't sure that this project management course was a good fit for me. I thought I needed to have some kind of digital project that was all worked out to be able to talk through. Thankfully, that isn't the case. In fact, I was a lot further along in thinking through my new project than I thought I was. We did some important exercises to help define the project, figure out its scope, and determine who I might need and what skills I may need to develop to carry out this project.

In a nutshell, my new project focuses on the development of a specific kind of Nigerian Masculinity in the context of transnational migration over the course of several decades--from the 1950s to the present. It will trace how migrants have reshaped local expectations of success and prestige over the course of the past seventy years, taking into consideration the changing conditions shaping the impetus to migrate and access to resources that would enable migration. The project will rely heavily on oral histories with some text-based archives (for materials covering the 1950s and early 1960s).

Here are the main take-aways from today's session: 
> 1. Having a project plan will help me communicate effectively about the project and seek out support, in terms of funding and other resources. It will also keep me (and my team) organized and on task. 
> 2. A project plan is not set in stone. It is a kind of living document (artifact? product?) that can be tweaked in the face of challenges and constraints I might encounter along the way. The instructor provided a helpful flow chart to help conceptualize sets of tasks and contingencies that can be adapted.
> 3. A multi-faceted project like mine can be broken down into phases, each with its own plan and set of tasks, so these plans can be nested within the overall project plan.
> 4. I need to consider time frames for doing the work more concretely than I currently do.
> 5. I will have to move out of my comfort zone of working alone to working in callaboration with a "team" of people with different skills and levels of expertise to accomplish the full scope of this project. 

Lots to learn! But, I am excited to get moving on this.
