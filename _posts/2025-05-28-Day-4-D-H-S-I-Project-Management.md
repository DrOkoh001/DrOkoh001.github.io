### Day 3 of the Project Management Course ###

Today we learned how to conceptualize and organize the various taskes associated with our projects. The end result was a Gantt Chart. I was really insecure about having to organize the tasks into a timeline. One of the more challenging aspects of my ADHD is "time blindness." I really struggle conceptualizing time horizons. It turned out to be okay; in fact, it was really helpful to use the Gantt Chart method! Here is a visual representation of the process we went through to get to using a digital Gantt Chart (I got a little ahead of the class using a Google Sheets template, but I was so enthusiastic about this method that I had to take a stab at it.):

### VERY COOL! ### 

I'm having such a good time being a student this week. It is so rare for me to have such a rich learning opportunity. It feels good to enter into this new project with a much better handle on planning and design before even starting. Hopefully this will help keep me from stretching this project out another 18 years!
