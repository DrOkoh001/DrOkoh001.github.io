# Day 1: Pre-Workshop Day, DHSI 2025

Dr. Bunzli and I arrived yesterday in Montreal and we spent most of our time after arrival finding and getting registered at the hostel on the University of Montr√©al's campus, and then getting oriented. Today, our Loyola student cohort arrived. We figured out the logistics of using the metro and bus system to and from the airport, and then had a nice meal together. Tonight, we each set up our blog for this experience. As I type this, I just learned how to use markdown text to make this post AND add an image. Squeeee!

I'm looking forward to learning all about project management at the DHSI. As I begin my new research project, I hope to start on the right foot, with a clear plan and project design.
