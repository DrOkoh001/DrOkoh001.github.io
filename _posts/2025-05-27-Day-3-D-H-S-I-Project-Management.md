# Day 2 of the Project Management Course #

After taking some time to think through some of the initial parameters of this new research project on Nigerian migration, I was able to return to class today with a bit more confidence regarding some of the details of what the project will need and how it might be organized. It is clear I will have to organize the project into three to four phases. 

### Phase 1: Planning and Design ###
> This phase should take about 6-12 months. I am currently in this phase. Since I am committed to having a slow-paced summer, I expect this phase to run from now until May/June 2026. Phase 1 will involve the following elements:
> 1. mapping out the project plan;
> 2. Initial research on the subject and existing scholarship. This includes finding any quantitative data on Nigerian migration since 1950;
> 3. Determining who I will need to collaborate with (librarians, archivists, potential research assistants, computer scientists, colleagues with digital humanities experience);
> 4. Determine where I will find my research subjects in Marlyand (cultural associations, churches, particular neighborhoods);
> 5. Apply for IRB clearance (includes designing survey and interview questions)
> 6. Determine the tools and technologies I will need to create a simple, usable, nimble database and a website.
> 7. Seek and apply for grant support (Loyola, Maryland, national grants, foundations and other non-profit organizations)

### Phase 2: Archival and Field Research in Maryland ###
> Once I receive IRB clearance, I hope to take 8-10 months interviewing Nigerian immigrants in Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, DC. At the same time, I hope to seek out data and records at local, state, and national archives/repositories, including the Maryland Center for Art and Culture, the Library of Congress, the Schomburg Library, even archives at historically black colleges and universities (a signficant group of Nigerian students studied at these institutions). Archival research would be constrained by my teaching schedule, funding, and available time for focused research.

### Phase 3: Archival and Field Research in Nigeria ###
> This phase will depend heavily on funding and time constraints. I may need to devote my summer time for this research: May to end of July 2027. I will need to determine a subset of research subjects to trace their stories back to Nigeria for further field research (surveys and interviews). This will depend on attaining permission/consent to carry out this research with their family and community members. I hope to be able to complete this phase within a single summer, although there is a possibility of having to do a follow-up visit in the summer of 2028.

### Phase 4: Writing and Publication ###
> This will be a rolling activity throughout the project. I expect to publish two or three articles from the initial phases of this work. Ultimately, I will work toward producing a book manuscript. Depending on which aspects of the project I focus on, I will approach a variety of journals and publishers. Top of the list: History in Africa; African Studies Review; Journal of African History; Ohio University Press; Duke University Press; and perhaps Cambridge University Press.

In the project management course today, we spent time thinking through skills and responsibility matrices to help us think through pulling together a working team. We also got to consider and discuss the importance of a team charter, and the beginning of a project plan. These were all very helpful in further clarifying the project goals and project plan.
